    <p>So you chose to take the ceramics class. your first class start and you feel so out of place you have never taken an art class before, and you doubted if you belong there. The instucter walks in he is older and dressed casually and greets the class. He hands out a small blob of clay and said just play with it make things destroy iy start over observe the clay and enjoy yourselves. He takes a seat with all of us and does the same. The first day puts you at ease and you start making projects starting the next class. the first project is pinch pots. The next next project is the coffee cup, you stuggle with the handle but the cup while looking kind of maimed is still good. The final project was a huge coil vase. The summer continues and comes to a close and you are satisfied that you took this class it was more interesting than you thought it would be, but you feel very satisfied with your choice. </p>
