    <p>You chose to travel down the east coast until you reach the Flordia Keys. You stoped at every major city along the way. You had to see New York City and you did. It was as amazing and it was everything you dreamed of. You had to stop at Cape Cod it was beautiful so senic compared to the city. You took a trip to Gettysberg tou wanted to see the area it is a historical site after all. You do this all the way to Flordia you still have a few weeks left of the summer after you reach Miami. You make your last strech to the keys see the sites there and spend the rest of the summer which is like 3 weeks laying on the beach, snorkeling, and petting sharks. you dread going back to New York because you have had so much fun. You regret nothing and loved everything that you did.</p>
