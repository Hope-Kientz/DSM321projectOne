    <p>You chose to travel out west to see the whole country. You want to see all the national parks they are America's treasure after all. You slowly make the trip from New York to L.A. You want to try to meet a celebrity in L.A. before you go home. You visit the grand canyon, joshua tree, and even yellow stone. The parks are so beautiful and scenic you took so many pictures posted them to instagram and even took videos and posted them on tik tok. You are so happy camping and loving nature, seeing all the animals. You are approached by a hitch hiker you can either give this stranger a ride or tell him to take a hike.
