You pull off to the side of the road and ask them to get out polietly. The person pulls a gun out and says but you said that you would give me ride. Do I make you nervous? You try to muster your strongest voice and tell them to get out of your car. They leap across the gap between the two seats he puts the barrel of the pistol in your mouth and their hand on your throat squeezing hard, you can't breath everything starts going hazy and you black out. You wake up dazed and confused your van is in a different place in a heavily wooded area. You start to panic you are bound and gagged, your attacker appears suddenly they are dirty now and smiling viciously at you. They force themselves on you, and you try to scream but you can't no one can hear you. There is no way for you to escape and you are very afraid they pull out a very large knife puts it up to your throat and then everything goes black. You have been murdered.
