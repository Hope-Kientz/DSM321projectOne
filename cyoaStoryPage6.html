    <p>So you chose to take the computer class. You know it is a practical choice. The first day feels stiff the teacher walks in and she is stiff as well as dressed somewhat formally. She started right away, she gives out some hand outs and instructs to open microsoft word and open the project file. She says follow the format on the hand out and she will check our work when we are done ask questions if you have any, and you can leave when you finish. The class was boring you didn't feel engaged or excited about any of it. The class drug on and never seemed to end you just wanted it to end. The summer never seemed to end but when it did you feel unfufilled and sad. You regret your choice and looking back you wished that you had taken ceramics class instead.</p>
