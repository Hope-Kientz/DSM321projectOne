    <p>You told the hitchhiker to take a hike. You sped down the road thinking we don't pick up strangers my mother taught me better than that. You keep driving further west until you get to L.A. The city is so big and beautiful, the traffic is terrible no wonder people get angry while they drive. You go see all the sites and spend the night in a hotel its been a while since you slept some where other than the van you have lived out of for over two months. You go out into the city and you happen to run into Emma Stone she is out running errands. You squeal with excitement and can't help but to be so excited. You walk up to her and say hello and ask can I have your autograph, and maybe a picture? I love your movies and it would mean so much to me. She agrees and you can't belive it. You just met a celebrity, but you didn't want to bother her further and bid her a good day before leaving. You call your mom so excited you tell her all about how you met Emma Stone and how she is so cool. You are completly starstruck, you post the picture to instagram gushing about how nice she is and how excited you were to meet her. You head back home feeling happy and fufilled from your trip you got to go on an adventure.</p>
