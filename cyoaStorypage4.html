    <p>So youy chose to travel across the country. Grab your bags a toothbrush and some cash. where do you want to go first you are in Buffalo New York. Where should you visit first maybe go to New York City befor heading to Cape cod to see the beaches, or go west and see the grand canyon and visit all of the National Parks? Its so difficult to make a decision go south and explore the coast line or go out west and visit the parks.</p>
