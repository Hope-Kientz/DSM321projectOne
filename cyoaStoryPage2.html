    <p>So you chose to take the summer class. Now you havt to choose if you want to take the ceramics class or the computer class. On the one hand the ceramics class will be lots of fun and you will have some fun things that you made to take home. On the other hand the computer class would be more practical for school and life but the same computer class is offered every summer. Could you perhaps wait to take the computer class next year. You continue to weight the options before making your choice. </p>
